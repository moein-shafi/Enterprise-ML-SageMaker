    "# Managing and Cleaning Up Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson focuses on the essential management tasks that every SageMaker practitioner must master: checking endpoint status and configuration details, then properly cleaning up resources to avoid ongoing charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will teach you two complementary approaches to endpoint management: `programmatic management` using Python and the SageMaker SDK, and `command-line management` using the AWS CLI. The Python approach provides detailed programmatic access that's ideal for automation and integration into larger workflows, while the AWS CLI offers quick, interactive commands perfect for manual inspection and cleanup tasks. By mastering both approaches, you'll have the flexibility to choose the most appropriate tool for each management scenario you encounter.\n"
