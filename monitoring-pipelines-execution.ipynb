    "# Monitoring Pipeline Executions\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective monitoring involves several key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<u>Track overall execution status</u>**: Know whether your pipeline is still running, has completed successfully, or has encountered an error.\n",
    "- **<u>Understand execution timing</u>**: Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your workflows by analyzing how long each execution and step takes.\n",
    "- **<u>Examine individual step details</u>**: See what each component of your pipeline accomplished, how long it took, and whether it succeeded or failed.\n",
    "- **<u>Diagnose and resolve issues</u>**: Use detailed execution information to quickly identify and fix problems when they occur.\n",
    "- **<u>Optimize costs and resources</u>**: Monitor execution times to spot steps that might be over-provisioned or underperforming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This monitoring capability is crucial for maintaining robust ML workflows for several reasons. In production environments, pipelines often run on schedules or are triggered by events, and you need to ensure they complete successfully without manual intervention. When issues do occur, detailed execution information helps you quickly identify and resolve problems. Additionally, monitoring execution times helps you optimize costs by identifying steps that might be over-provisioned or underperforming."
